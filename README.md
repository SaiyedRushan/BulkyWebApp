# BulkyWebApp

This is a simple .NET Core project to familiarize myself with .NET Core, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and C# programming language. The project provides a web application where CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations can be performed with a SQL Server database through a webpage.

Here's a breakdown of the project based on the provided information:

.NET Core: The project is built using .NET Core, which is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern applications. It allows developers to create applications that can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

MVC Pattern: The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. MVC separates the application into three main components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: Displays the user interface to the user.
Controller: Handles user input, interacts with the model, and updates the view.

C#: The project is written in the C# programming language, which is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language used for developing .NET applications. C# is the primary language for .NET Core development.

SQL Server: The project utilizes a SQL Server database to store data. It uses Entity Framework Core, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations.

CRUD Operations: The web application allows users to perform CRUD operations on the SQL Server database. CRUD represents the four fundamental operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Users can create new records, retrieve existing records, update records, and delete records through the web interface.

The project serves as a hands-on learning experience to gain familiarity with .NET Core, MVC pattern implementation, and working with databases using C# and SQL Server. To gain a deeper understanding of the project's implementation, you can explore the code, documentation, and any additional project details provided in the repository.
